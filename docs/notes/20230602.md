# Pureconfig like library for java record classes

- Approach 1: Convert java record class definition to scala case class, use pureconfig and then convert the created object back to record object.
- Approach 2: Implement from scratch borrowing logic from pureconfig.

## UPDATE: lightbend/config already supports populating configs via POJO / bean classes
