# Choice of programming languages

Throughout the years I have picked up many programming languages, used some of them for big projects or some for smaller hobby projects. These notes capture some of my opinions after working with them.

## Scala
- https://mungingdata.com/scala/maintenance-nightmare-upgrade/
- Scala is really only appropriate for difficult problems, like building compilers, that benefit from powerful Scala programming features.

As Reynolds mentioned, Scala is a good language for Spark because Catalyst and Tungsten rely heavily on pattern matching.

Scala should be avoided for easier problems that donâ€™t require advance programming language features.

- Personal
  - Scala is swiss knife sorts of, can do almost everything barring maybe systems programming (scala native ecosystem is not quite there yet.)
  - The language is just way too powerful, supports multiple paradigms, multiple modelling methods in the the language itself. This also means it is too difficult to learn.

## Haskell

## Golang

## Python

## Java
