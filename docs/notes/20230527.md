# Creating a Personal Website

This guide covers how a personal website similar to this can be created.

## Static site generator

We will be using a static site generator for our site. It will keep it simple to maintain and we can use some of the free web hosting tools available.

There are multiple options available for generating static sites.

- Jekyll
- Mkdocs
- Hugo
- Docusaurus

We are going to use mkdocs together with its material-mkdocs theme. It uses python and yaml files for config.

Check [mkdocs-material](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) for setup

## github pages

Static sites can be deployed using github pages, which is free of cost for public projects.
A repo named `utk-spartan.github.io` stores the static-site configuration together with CI pipeline to generate it.
